        What is Composting?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Composting is a biological process where organic materials, such as food scraps, leaves, branches, and sawdust, are transformed into valuable compost. Compost is a natural fertilizer that enriches soil, improves its structure, and provides essential nutrients to plants. This process occurs thanks to microorganisms like bacteria and fungi that break down organic materials into simpler chemical compounds.

      <div id="square">
      <ol>
        <li>
        Collecting Materials: Use organic waste like vegetable scraps, fruits, eggshells, coffee grounds, paper, leaves, and grass. Avoid meat, fats, and dairy to prevent pests.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preparing the Bin: Place organic materials in a well-ventilated compost bin or pile.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mixing and Moistening: Regularly mix and moisten materials to ensure proper decomposition.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat Generation: Composting generates heat (50-70°C), speeding up the process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decomposition: In 3-6 months, materials break down into nutrient-rich compost for your garden.

        Benefits of Composting
      </h2>
      <p>
        Composting offers numerous benefits for both the environment and gardeners:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Waste Reduction: </b>Composting reduces the amount of organic waste sent to landfills, helping to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and lessen environmental impact.
        </li>
        <li>
         <b>Soil Improvement:</b>Compost enriches the soil with organic matter, enhancing its structure, water retention capacity, and nutrient availability for plants.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cost Savings:</b> Using compost as a fertilizer can lower the costs of purchasing commercial fertilizers and soil conditioners.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Biodiversity Boost: </b> Composting supports the development of beneficial microorganisms, earthworms, and other soil organisms that contribute to a healthy garden ecosystem.
